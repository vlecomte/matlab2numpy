From MATLAB to `numpy`
======================

This repository contains translations from MATLAB to `numpy`
of the homeworks from UCL course LFSAB1104 in 2014.
The problems were created by Vincent Legat and his team.

This is a proof of concept: `numpy` is a perfectly adapted tool for the course.
The only things holding us back are old habits and long-lasting deals with
Mathworks.
Python, `numpy`, `scipy` and the companion libraries are free
(in both meanings), faster, easier to setup, and easier to use.
